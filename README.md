# BudGet - Powershell and JS application to track expenditures

An application I developed in my free time to track my own expenditures.

Heavily inspired from Get-Waifu, a similar project in Powershell which uses a Telegram interface to collect data.

Contains a general-purpose command line, the usage of which has been described on the homepage at expenses.html.
